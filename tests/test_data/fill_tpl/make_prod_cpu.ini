# Important Notes for this configuration file:
# 1) a [main] section is required
# 2) optional sections are [tpl_vals] and [tpl_val_equations]
# 3) [tpl_val_equations] allows key values to be calculated based on other key values. Equations are evaluated in the
#    order provided, so if an equation depends on the value computed from another equation, list the dependent
#    equation after its inputs.
# 4) Multiple values and equations may be listed for any keys. In that case, the program will create multiple output
#    files. If a static 'filled_tpl_name' is provided, the file will be overwritten, leaving only one filled file at
#    the end. The 'filled_tpl_name' can include keys (i.e. filled_tpl_name = {key1}.txt), so if multiple values are
#    listed for key1 (i.e. key1 = A,B,C), multiple output files will be created (A.txt, B.txt, C.txt)."
